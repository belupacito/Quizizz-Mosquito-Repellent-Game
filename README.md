# Quizizz-Mosquito-Repellent-Game
There was a game on quizizz, formerly known as wayground.com
I played it in my chemistry class.
It is supposed to be a educational game platform, where people answered questions.
The game is in the mastery peak gamemode, where there are mini games in between the rounds.
One of the games is the mosquito repellent game, which I find very fun, which is why I made this project.
